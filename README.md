# STAT240---Data-Science-Modeling-I

This course introduced reproducible data management, modeling, and analysis through a practical, hands‑on, case‑study‑driven approach. I worked within an integrated statistical computing environment to perform data wrangling, program in R, create data graphics and visualizations, and apply concepts such as random variables and probability. The course emphasized building and evaluating data models and generating fully reproducible reports using R Markdown, applying these skills to diverse datasets to address open‑ended analytical questions.
